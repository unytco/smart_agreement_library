# Smart Agreement Code Library

## Welcome to the Smart Agreement Code Library

A Smart Agreement is a Recorded Agreement, Verifiably Executed. It is similar to a Blockchain Smart Contract, but designed to take advantage of the Agent-Centric Holochain Application Architecture.

## Smart Agreements

See the [library directory](./library) for the Smart Agreements.

Each Smart Agreement has its own directory in that library directory. Each Smart Agreement should have some contextual information and a summary in comments at the top of its execution_code.rhai file.

## Documentation

## More Info and Where to Run Smart Agreements

Smart Agreements are designed to be run in a Peer-to-Peer Unyt Accounting application. Downloads and Documentation are available at https://github.com/unytco/unyt-releases.
